Microwatt + Crypto Acceleration SoC

Concept: Integrate a hardware AES / SHA / Post-Quantum Crypto accelerator alongside Microwatt.

Why: Security is critical in open hardware. A CPU + crypto block is a great showcase for secure IoT / communications.

Use Case: Microwatt handles control + OS tasks, while crypto accelerator handles secure boot, encryption, authentication.

Value: Practical, well-scoped, and implementable with available open-source IP (or AI-generated RTL).
